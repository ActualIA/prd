# Business Model

ActualIA would have two versions : the free one and the paid one.

- Free plan : No audio generation, no news regeneration, limited to 3 context generations per day.
- Paid plan : Unlimited\* audio, news and context generation

\* : Paid plan will still be limited to 20 audio and news generation and 50 context generation to limit malicious users and have time to detect them.

ActualIA has three main expenses : news transcript generation, audio generation and context generation. Today, a news transcript generation costs 0.005\$ and an audio generation costs 0.05\$.

This means that every non-paid plan user costs 0.15\$ per month, and every paid plan user costs 1.65\$ per month. Given that paid plan users can regenerate the transcript (and the audio) but won't do it often (on average 5 times per month) an everage paid plan user costs around 1,95\$.

Context generation won't be used by every user, we think that 40% of our users will use the feature three times a week, 40% of them will use it twice a day and 20% of them will use it 5 time per day. This adds a 0.011\$ expense to each user.

Since we are expecting 10% of paid plan over all users, a paid plan user would have to pay at least 3.13\$ for the app to be financially stable.

Considering that these generation costs fluctuate often and that ActualIA needs to be maintained, the paid plan will be proposed for 5,99\$. If we achieve our 5000 user basis, this will lead to a revenue stream of around 1430\$ per month, which can be used to pay a few hours per month a developper to maintain the application and to handle administrative expenses.

If more revenue comes in, it will be reinvested in the developpement of the application to improve it.
