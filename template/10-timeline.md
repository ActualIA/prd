# Timeline/Resource Planning

*What’s the overall schedule you’re working towards?*

*What resources are required?*

*What are the intermediate milestones?*

*List identified sprints*

We plan to iterate over the POC product we submitted on our 4th semester Milestone in order to build the **Minimum Viable Product** this document describes. To do this, we intend to mobilize a team of **7 engineers**
over a period of **9 weeks** split in 3 intermediary milestones. The goal of each is: 

 - **Milestone 1:** Design consolidation and iOS development
 - **Milestone 2:** Internal testing, pre-launch marketing efforts
 - **Milestone 3:** Full deployment, beta test to launch pipeline
