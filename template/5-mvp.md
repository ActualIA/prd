# The MVP

ActualIA's MVP will bring news to user. To achieve so it will integrate the following features :

- News provider selection on the main providers (RSS flows, google news, ...)
- Topic selection over a wide range of subjects
- News summarization, on both number of news and length of them
- Audio reading, aiming a one minute audio file

ActualIA's MVP mustn't be a black box that only provides news, but also tell where it comes from. To achieve this goal, ActualIA's MVP will feature :

- The original article for every summarized news, with a link to its location
- News context inspection, that can be used by simply taking a photo of an article to get the context around it

## Personas and Scenarios

*Who are the target personas for this product?*

*Which is the key persona?*

*High-level scenarios to adopt, use and share the product.*

ActualIA doesn't have a key audience, it targets all citizens since everyone should keep track of the actuality.

Being well informed on recent events is a encouraged in society, and since being informed with ActualIA takes no time (without counting the download of the app and the onboarding) many people would like to download only by hearing about it.

Moreover, the application offers a way to share the transcript to other people, through the app and on other medias. When someone will have an interesting news that he wants to share, he will recommand the application to another potential user.

The application will be used daily, since it produces a news recap every day, with an alarm set by the user to set up a routine. The alarm will most likely be set for the morning when awakening, to here the news while getting dress up (before going to work at least), or for the evening, when coming back home. It could also be set for a break during the day.
