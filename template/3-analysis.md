# Analysis of the Situation

> *What are the competing products in the market today?*
> *What are the complementary products in the market today?*

There are three factors that we have to analyse : source mixing, subject personnalisation and unicity of news providers location.

Nowardays, there are lot of news providers, however most of them have their own journalists and does not mix sources up. There are some examples like [*GroundNews*](https://ground.news/) that mixes political sources up to have less biaised news, or at least now from which political side sources come from.
Furthermore, news providers are often specialized in one subject. Search engines and news letters solve this problem, but are not as usable as an app (sometimes newsletters doesn't let you unsubscribe easily). Newsletters like [*Pour la Science*](https://www.pourlascience.fr/util/inscription-newsletter/) try to mix sources together, however the user doesn't have the control over the sources.
Another issue that newsletters solves is the multiciplicity of sources locations. However the same problem happen again : no control over sources.

It is important to note that ActualIA is not a news provider but a news aggregator, ActualIA is a complementary to the news providers.

ActualIA is also able to provide context on an article, which is something solved by assistants like Google Assistant and ChatGPT.

Having a centralized place where someone can find all the news they are interested in while fetching them from the sources is an idea that wasn't implemented when the project started. However, while we were developping the project, another very similar app came out : [*Azernis*](https://www.azernis.com/). This idea is currently a novel field that has to be explored, and it is likely that many new actors will enter the market in the comming months.
