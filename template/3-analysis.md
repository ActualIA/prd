# Analysis of the Situation

There are three factors that we have to analyse : source mixing, subject personalization and centralization of news providers.

Nowadays, there are a lot of news providers. However, most of them have their own journalists and do not mix sources up. There are some examples like [*GroundNews*](https://ground.news/) that mix political sources up to have less biaised news, or at least tell you from which political side the sources come from.
Furthermore, news providers are often specialized in one subject. Search engines and newsletters solve this problem, but are not as usable as an app (newletters can sometimes be hard to unsubcribe from).
Newsletters also try to solve the problem of source mixing, a notable example of this is [*Pour la Science*](https://www.pourlascience.fr/util/inscription-newsletter/), a newsletter that mixes sources up to have less biaised news. However, the user doesn't have control over which sources are used.

It is important to note that ActualIA is not a news provider but a news aggregator, which makes it complementary to news providers.

ActualIA is also capable of providing context for an article, a feature similarly addressed by assistants like Google Assistant and ChatGPT.

Having a centralized place where someone can find all the news they are interested in while fetching them from the sources is an idea that didn't exist at the time we started the project. However, while we were developping the project, another app came out with a very similar concept: [*Azernis*](https://www.azernis.com/). This idea is currently a novel field that has yet to be explored, and it is likely that many new actors will enter the market in the coming months.
