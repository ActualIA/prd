# Functional Requirements

ActualIA's core feature is the generation of a personalized news transcript, summarizing the day's main events with a focus on the user's interests. This transcript is generated by the OpenAI API, which is called by the backend server. The transcript is then converted into a voiceover by the TTS API, and the audio file is sent to the user's device. The user can listen to the news summary as a podcast, every morning, straight to their headphones. The users can select their main news sources (Google News, RSS Feeds, Telegram channels) and their main interests, which will then be sent to the Supabase server, and the app will centralize, filter, and summarize the inputs autonomously.

The app also allows users to inspect the original source of any news event cited in the transcript. Additionally, users can point their phone's camera at an article in a newspaper, and the app will provide context regarding said article, using Google ML Kit's OCR recognition technology as well as OpenAI GPT's API to get the actual context.

Another feature present in the app is the RSS-like view, which allows users to see the untouched text of the news articles, as returned by the source.
