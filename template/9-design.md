# Design and Implementation

## Frontend

*List the key libraries, languages, components used by the MVP.*

*If applicable, describe essential screens.*

The main design language of the application comes in the adoption of Google's massively popular Material Design 3 design specification, which is not only considered a standard in Android app UI design, but is also strongly adaptable to the iOS design language, as Google themselves has admitted [*in the past*](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722130/google-ios-app-material-design-components-uikit). We are able to cross these beams thanks to our usage of the [*Flutter*](https://flutter.dev/) development framework and the Dart programming language.

A Figma board is used to keep the design uniform throughout development, and it would be advisable to work out a true visual identity of the app (color palette, main font pairings and design elements) in order to keep communication around the app (advertisement and presentation) consistent. 

## Backend

*Decompose the MVP into functional blocks.*

`/** I DONT KNOW */`

## Data Model

*What data are you collecting / managing?*

*How is it organised?*

*Where is it stored?*

*How is it shared/copied/cached?*

## Security Considerations

## Infrastructure and Deployment

*How is the application developed, tested and deployed?*

*Any special infrastructure requirements.*

## Test Plan

*How is the application developed, tested and deployed?*

*Any special infrastructure requirements.*
