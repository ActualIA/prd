# Design and Implementation

## Frontend

*List the key libraries, languages, components used by the MVP.*

*If applicable, describe essential screens.*

The main design language of the application comes in the adoption of Google's massively popular Material Design 3 design specification, which is not only considered a standard in Android app UI design, but is also strongly adaptable to the iOS design language, as Google themselves has admitted [in the past](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722130/google-ios-app-material-design-components-uikit). We are able to cross these beams thanks to our usage of the [*Flutter*](https://flutter.dev/) development framework and the *Dart* programming language.
