# Non-Functional Requirements

## Security, privacy, and data retention policies

*Which are the applicable laws and regulations?*

*What are your internal policies?*

*Which privacy features do you need from the phone?*

ActualIA uses Google authentication to log in. The user's email address is stored in the database for identification purposes. The user can also choose to use the OCR article context inspection feature, which requires camera access. To function properly, our app also needs access to the phone's storage to store the transcripts and audio files generated by the app. The app also needs access to the phone's speaker to play the audio files, as well as the alarm settings to schedule the daily news summary. Both of these features are only available to users with a paid plan.

## Adoptions, Scalability and Availability

*What kind of traffic patterns do you expect to see?*

*Are there known periods of bursty traffic that the MVP must be designed to support?*
