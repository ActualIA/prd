# The Value Proposition

Given the situation above, our product aims to satisfy the needs of a demographic that understands its need to stay on top of the news every day, but that feels they lack the time, energy and investment necessary to do so. We offer an all in one solution to centralize the events that might interest a user, and deliver them as audio, minimizing the amount of time they spend looking at their screen. 

Our customers are the users, both on the free and the paid plans. For them, it's clear that our product offers real value. 

ActualIA delivers summarized news directly to the user, both as a transcript on both plans, as well as audio generation, for the paid plan. This saves the user time on their daily routine, and it allows them a larger variety of news than if they were to look through their sources. The app is uniquely suited to address the pain points of the targeted users' news experience, since it's designed to be fast and easy to use, always relevant to their interests and deeply customizable.

The convenience we add to a task that the user perceives as both time consuming and deeply necessary means our app's added value is easy to defend, and can be communicated in terms of the user's want to stay on top of global and local events. Additionally, our usage of state of the art technology allows our proposition to be a relevant and timely solution to the challenges it tackles.
