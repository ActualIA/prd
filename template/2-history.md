The POC we built up to the last course milestone implements most of the core features we planned for our product, such as news gathering, summary and voiceover generation, RSS-like view for simple aggregation, and context retrieval through OCR. With the main user stories in place, what we need for an MVP is an iOS version, as well as developing and integrating a payment plan to our application.
